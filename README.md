FAQ
------------
### But _WHY_ if we have Docker version?
I took over abandoned installation script because author didn't want to develop it anymore. Excuse was that everything moved to Docker.

In my personal opinion that's a **bad move**, and no one else fixed script - so I did. Docker itself is not a bad idea, but I would like to see it in dynamic, scalable environments where it grows and shrinks depending on workload.

That's certainly NOT the case here. rtorrent is ran usually 24/7, does not work in cluster solutions or anything close to that. So sticking it into Docker is 1. waste of resources (CPU, disk) 2. Security risk (everything you'd normally have PLUS Docker problems).
I might be the only person using this script - so be it. No containers for this app.
